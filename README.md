# Improved-TSA-Guide

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to give new TSA members the information they need to begin competing. This means giving practical advice, often not stated directly in the given TSA forms, and providing examples to set beginners on the right path. This website should be the one stop to get all the information you need to compete.

## How to Contribute
You can talk about the project in the discussions tab and propose suggestions. You can also create a branch to directly edit a page, and one of our editors will look it over for approval.
