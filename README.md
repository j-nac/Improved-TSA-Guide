# Improved-TSA-Guide

## Introduction - Letter to the user

When I first joined TSA, I was lucky to have amazing advisors that gave me the information to win competitions. However, I realize that not everyone has the same access. The aim of this project is to give new TSA members the information they need to begin competing. This means giving practical advice, often not stated directly in the given TSA forms, and providing examples to set beginners on the right path. This website should be the one stop to get all the information you need to compete.

I hope this website is useful to you, and best of luck.
