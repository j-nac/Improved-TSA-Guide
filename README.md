# Improved-TSA-Guide

## An open letter to the reader

My first year was a whirlwind of trial and error. Luckily, I had experienced advisors that helped me navigate through the TSA competition. However, I realize that not everyone has the same access.

The aim of this project is to give new TSA members the information they need to begin competing. This means giving practical advice, often not stated directly in the given TSA forms, and providing examples to set beginners on the right path. This website should be the one stop to get all the information you need to compete.

I hope you gain something from this, and best of luck.
