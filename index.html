    <p>- Note from the repository creator:<br>
      Hello all,<br>
      The thing with making stuff is that the more you do things, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you realize how awful things you made in the past were. While working on this, I realized I could do a lot better (and make my life easier). I copied all the information and pasted it <a href="https://j-nac.github.io/TSA-Reference/">here</a> where all further updates will be made. I used an open source Jekyll theme I found, so unlike this repo, it's not made from scratch. Nonetheless, I really only care about the information I share. I plan to continue working on this for a few more years (when I have the time that is). I'll keep this site alive though because why not. Have fun TSAing!<br>
      Best, j-nac<br>
