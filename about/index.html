    <h1 id="header">About</h1>
    <p>The Improved TSA Guide was created in April, 2021 by students in the Edmonds School District as a guide for new Technology Student Association (TSA) members. It is based on a similar project by Github users j-nac and therealanby which is now private. That's pretty much it; this project is very early in development.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="contribute">How can I contribute?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This project is not endorsed the Technology Student Association. We need volunteers to keep it running. There are many ways you can contribute including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Updating information</li>
      <li>Adding new event information</li>
      <li>Finding and fixing bugs or grammatical errors</li>
      <li>Adding new stories or updates for the news section</li>
      <li>Adding images</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://github.com/j-nac/Improved-TSA-Guide" target="_blank">Github repository</a> where you can add issues, fix issues, and join the discussion. For more major updates like redesigning the site, contact the <a href="mailto:jnac8080@gmail.com">maintainer</a> of this repository.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="rivals">Won't This Benefit Rival Competition?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Probably, but that's ok. At the end of the day, TSA is about learning; learning about career opportunities in STEM, learning to improve yourself, learning to be a better leader. We believe information should be free and we hope everyone takes something useful from this project.</p>
