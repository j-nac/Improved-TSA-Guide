        <p>The Improved TSA Guide was created in April, 2021 by students in the Edmonds School District as a practical, community-run guide for new Technology Student Association (TSA) members. It is based on a similar project by Github users j-nac and therealanby which is now private. That's pretty much it; this project is very early in development.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="contribute">How can I contribute?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This project is not endorsed by TSA; it needs volunteers to keep it running. There are many ways you can contribute.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update information</li>
            <li>Add new event information</li>
            <li>Find and fix bugs or grammatical errors</li>
            <li>Add new stories or updates for the news section</li>
            <li>Add images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://github.com/j-nac/Improved-TSA-Guide" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. For more major updates like redesigning the site, contact the <a href="mailto:jnac8080@gmail.com">maintainer</a> of this repository.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="rivals">Won't This Benefit Rival Competition?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Probably, but that's ok. At the end of the day, TSA is about learning; learning about career opportunities in STEM, learning to improve yourself, learning to be a better leader. We believe information should be free not kept under lock and key. We hope everyone gains something from this project.</p>
